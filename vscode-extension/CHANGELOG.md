# Release Notes

# 0.5.1

## New

- Change "force" semantics:

  Blocks that require a force move/navigate are detected in advance,
  and trying to move/navigate to them will fail silently. Instead of
  the old error notification, the background of the blocks is
  now a different color.

- Add block navigation commands:

  Regular "navigate" commands will not navigate to parent scope,
  for that there are the "force navigate" commands.

- Make "block mode" a vscode context (useful for keybindings).
- Add "block mode" status bar indicator.
- Add "select current block" command:

- Add configurable colors.
- Add default keybindings (only active when "block mode" is on):

  | Command                        | Keybinding (cmd on mac) |
  | ------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
  | `codeBlocks.moveUp`            | `alt+up`                |
  | `codeBlocks.moveDown`          | `alt+down`              |
  | `codeBlocks.moveUpForce`       | `alt+shift+up`          |
  | `codeBlocks.moveDownForce`     | `alt+shift+down`        |
  | `codeBlocks.navigateUp`        | `ctrl/cmd+up`           |
  | `codeBlocks.navigateDown`      | `ctrl/cmd+down`         |
  | `codeBlocks.navigateUpForce`   | `ctrl/cmd+shift+up`     |
  | `codeBlocks.navigateDownForce` | `ctrl/cmd+shift+down`   |

  Note that `codeBlocks.toggle`, the editor commands, and the
  `codeBlocks.selectBlock` are not bound by default.
